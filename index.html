			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p> I am a fourth year standing student at Carleton Univeristy. 
			I have completed four co-op terms at four very different organizations, 
			giving me lots of exeperience with all kinds of jobs and environments.
			A personal goal for myself throughout my education was to find my strengths and weaknesses
			as a programmer, as well as figuring out what kind of role and environments
			I would want to work in. Working in very different organizations allowed me
			to achieve this goal and find a love for web applications development leading 
			me to enventually create a web application for my honours project.

			<h1> House of Commons: Social Media Live Streamer </h1>
			<p> The Social Media Live Streamer was my first out of school exeperience
			at building a web application from scratch. The application was created
			with Node.JS, with the front-end created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
			The goal of this application was to allow Members of Parliament and their staff to be able to 
			create live streams of House sittings on their personal social media accounts. 
			Live streaming capabilities are very important to MP's as they allow for speeches
			they make in the House to easily be shared live with their constituents. 
			</p>
			<p> Below are a few images of the application. The application was made to be 
			very easy to use, as a lot of MP's and MP's staff are not always technologically savvy.
			The application was also designed to be mobile-friendly, 
			and works great on mobile devices.

			<h1> Fantasy Hockey Helper </h1>
			<a href="http://www.fantasyhockeyhelper.com"> Link to application </a>
			
			<p> Fantasy Hockey Helper was a web application I created for my Honours Project.
			The base of the application was created in Ruby on Rails, machine learning scripts
			were created in Python, and the front-end was created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			The grade I recieved for this project was an A+. The goal of this project was
			to create a tool that could help users of Yahoo Fantasy Hockey with all the decisions
			that fantasy hockey users face. To achieve this goal the biggest task at hand was creating
			projections via machine learning, for the performance of every player. Once the projections
			were completed, I then created the web application with all the required tools for the user.
			To create the tools, information on the user's leagues and teams was required. To do this
			I used ouath to connect to user's Yahoo Fantasy Sports account, and REST API calls to collect
			information. Some examples of tools made available to the user are draft 
			recommendations, free agent pick-up recommendations, recommendations on who to drop.
			and schedule comparisons, and player rankings. There was also weekly recommendations which allowed 
			users to see recommendations for a specific week, which is extremely useful in the playoffs.
			The application was also designed as a progressive web application, allowing users to save the 
			page to their mobile devices and have it work as mobile application.
			</p>
			<p> Below you can view images of the application. Linked here is my 
			honours project report, which goes much more in depth into the application:
